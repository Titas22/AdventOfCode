# AdventOfCode
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) submissions in Julia.

Just starting with the language so might not be the best solutions.

Will likely have very different style between days since I'm just trying to experiment around with Julia.


## Running
```
include("./scripts/init.jl") # Run once to set up and activate the environment

include("./scripts/Day_xx.jl") # use to run & re-run the actual script
```
